/* This is a coding social application data display case example.*/
/* Demonstrated SQL includes: 
(a) CREATE TABLE & INSERT records
(b) UPDATE entries
(c) ALTER TABLE to ADD new data column to table -- simulating addition to table "after" social app has been launched and used
(d) Setting default value for ALTER TABLE+ADD new column update
(e) DELETE specific record -- in this case, removing minor activity (meaning anyone under 18 years of age). */

/* Steps for this project -- 
Step 1: CREATE a table to store my data.
Step 2: INSERT a few example rows for the table.
Step 3: Use an UPDATE statement to emulate what happens when editing data within the app.
Step 4: Use an ALTER TABLE statement to ADD a column to the data set table; set default entry initially, then UPDATE records for new column data.
Step 5: Use a DELETE statement to emulate what occurs when deleting the data within the app. */
