# Spotify Analytics

-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- THEN, I created a table to insert Spotify Data into.
-- FINALLY, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

-- Creating a table:
/*
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)
*/

-- Now, I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the Table.

-- Next, I explored the data using the following SQL:

-- Check to see what fields are in the data.
/*
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata LIMIT 3
*/

-- Now, I began answering questions about the Spotify data.

-- #1: What is the average danceability by artist and track?

/*
SELECT artist_name AS "Artist Name", track_name AS "Song Title", AVG(danceability) AS "AVG Danceability" 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY "Song Title"
ORDER BY artist_name ASC
*/

-- #2: Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
/*
SELECT Artist_Name, Popularity 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
ORDER BY Popularity DESC LIMIT 10
*/

-- #3: What artist released the longest song?
/*
SELECT Artist_Name, Track_Name AS "Song Title", Duration_MS 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY Duration_MS DESC 
LIMIT 1
*/

-- #4: What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
/*
SELECT artist_name AS "Artist Name", track_name AS "Song Title", AVG(danceability) AS "AVG Danceability" 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY "Song Title"
ORDER BY Popularity DESC 
LIMIT 10
*/

-- #5: Rank all songs by Olivia Rodrigo in the database by popularity, beginning with the most popular song.
/*
SELECT Artist_Name, Track_Name AS "Song Title", Popularity 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
WHERE Artist_Name IN (Select Artist_Name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata WHERE Artist_Name = "Olivia Rodrigo")
ORDER BY popularity DESC
*/

-- #6: Of the songs that are NOT written in 4, rank them from fastest to slowest?
/*
SELECT Artist_Name, Track_Name, duration_ms, Time_Signature FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE time_signature < 4
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
*/
