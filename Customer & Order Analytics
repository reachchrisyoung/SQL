# Customer & Order Analytics

--SQLiteStudio Example Query
--Data pulled from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tg18j6pkfhlxem3/AACPDvxCUJAAo7WPD0LJW_Iwa?dl=0&preview=BIT_DB

--Began by looking at what kind of data is available between customers and JanSales
--Select * FROM customers LIMIT 20
--SELECT * FROM JanSales

-- #!: Find the amount of orders placed in January.
/*
SELECT count(orderID) AS "Orders in January" FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
*/

-- #2: Identify the amount of orders for an iPhone from January Sales
/*
SELECT count(orderid) AS "January iPhone Sales"
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';
*/

-- #3: List Customer Account Numbers for all orders placed within February.

/*Still gets 1,000 Results
SELECT customers.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderId
*/


-- NOTE: Duplicates were removed through the use of DISTINCT.
/* Still gets 1,000 Results
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum AS "Acct Numbers"
FROM BIT_DB.customers buyers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON buyers.order_id = feb.orderId
ORDER BY acctnum ASC
*/

--#4: Which product sold in January was the cheapest, and what was that product's price?
/* FIRST ATTEMPT -- Success.
SELECT DISTINCT product AS Product, MIN(price) AS Price FROM JanSales 
*/

-- SECOND ATTEMPT -- ineffective.
/*
SELECT DISTINCT product WHERE price IN 
(SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
*/

-- Researched solutions and tested various solution formats, seen below:

/* 1st Solution - Success
SELECT distinct product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (Select MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)
*/

/* 2nd Solution - Success
SELECT distinct product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1
*/


/* 3rd Solution - Success
SELECT DISTINCT product, MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1
*/

/* 4th Solution - Success 
SELECT product, MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1
*/

-- #5: Find the total revenue for each product sold in January.
-- REMINDER: qty of products sold (listed as Quantity) & price of the products needed to calculate revenue (listed as price). 
-- Columns I intend to use for this solution: Product, Quantity, price -- all in JanSales
/* First attempt -- Got Stuck.
SELECT product, Quantity, price FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY price DESC
*/

/* Attempt 2 - Revenue column isn't lining up. 
SELECT product AS Product, Quantity, price, SUM(Quantity*Price) AS REVENUE FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY price DESC
*/

/* Attempt 3 - Success and round Revenue Column to 2 decimal places. 
SELECT product AS Product, ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*price,2) AS Revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY price DESC
*/

-- #6: Multi-part question --
/* (a) In February - which products were sold at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101,
   (b) How many of each product were sold (at this location), and...
   (c) Identify the Total Revenue (of the products sold in February at this location).
*/
/* First Attempt - Success 
SELECT product AS Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Quantity, SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product
*/

-- #7: Give a quantity of customers who've ordered more than 2 products at a time during the month of February.  Include What the average amount spent for those customers was.
/* 1st Attempt - Got Stuck.
SELECT COUNT(customers.acctnum) AS "Customers", sum(quantity)*price AS Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE Quantity > 1
*/

-- 2nd Attempt - I think this works; AVG $ Spent = 3.86.
/*
SELECT COUNT(customers.acctnum) AS "Customers", avg(quantity)*price AS "AVG $ Spent" FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE Quantity > 2
*/

-- Starting Research

/* Attempt #1 - Success
SELECT COUNT(customers.acctnum) AS "Customers", avg(quantity*price) AS "AVG $ Spent" FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE Quantity > 2
*/


-- Additional Task: List all products sold in Los Angeles in February, while also identifying how many of each product was sold.
-- 1st Attempt - Success
/*
SELECT FebSales.Product AS "Product", SUM(FebSales.Quantity) AS "Qty" 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location LIKE "%Los Angeles%"
GROUP BY PRODUCT
ORDER BY price DESC
*/

-- #1: In New York, which locations received at least 3 orders in the month of January?  Include how many orders each of these locations had, in fact, received.
/* 1st Attempt -- Got Stuck
