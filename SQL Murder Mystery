# SQL Murder Mystery
# Database / Project at https://mystery.knightlab.com/#experienced.
# This project allowed me to reach as high as a double join SELECT statement, connecting as many as 3 tables in a single query.
# I had successfully found the hit man -- and discovered through additional queries that there was a mastermind who had bank rolled, and hired/ordered, the hit.

-- Began by browsing the tables in the database.
/* 
SELECT name 
FROM sqlite_master
WHERE type = 'table'
*/ 
 -- Found I had a crime_scene_report data table accessbile.
 
-- NEXT, I had navigated the various tables to see the data that was available;
-- As a sample query (of multiple queries to get a feel for the data available):
/*
SELECT sql 
FROM sqlite_master
WHERE name = 'drivers_license'
*/

-- The following is a statement to kick off the project:
/*
A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. 
The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. 
You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan.15, 2018 
and that it took place in SQL City. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene 
report from the police departmentâ€™s database.
*/

-- I began by pulling up the report for the incident, on the date and 
-- location aforementioned.
/*
SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE type = "murder" and city = "SQL City" AND date = "20180115"
*/
-- Murder on 20180115 in SQL City; security footage yielded 2 Witnesses:
/*Witness 1 Lives on the last house on Northwestern Dr.; 
  Witness 2 Annabel Lives Somewhere on Franklin Ave.
*/

--Find the 1st Witness
/*
SELECT name, address_number, address_street_name FROM person 
WHERE address_street_name LIKE "Northwestern Dr"
ORDER BY address_number DESC
*/
-- Witness 1 Information might be: Morty Schapiro, 4919 Northwestern Dr

-- Find Witness 2
/*
SELECT name, address_number, address_street_name FROM person 
WHERE name LIKE "%Annabel%"
*/
-- Witness 2 Information Found: Annabel Miller, 103 Franklin Street

-- More Details on Witness 1:
/*
SELECT * FROM person 
WHERE name = "Morty Schapiro"
ORDER BY address_number DESC
*/
-- Witness 1 Information might be: Morty Schapiro, 4919 Northwestern Dr
-- id = 14887, license id: 118009, ssn: 111564949

-- Look at the 2 Witness Statements:
/*
SELECT person.name, interview.transcript
FROM person JOIN interview
ON person.id = interview.person_id
WHERE person.id = 14887 OR person.id = 16371;
*/

-- Witness Statements found:
/*
Witness 1 States:
He heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out carrying a gym bag exclusive to 
Gold Members with the membership # starting with "48Z" displayed.  
Witness adds: 
The suspect was observed getting into a car; plate included "H42W". 

Witness 2, Annabel Miller Person_Id 16371 matches interview person_id, states: 
"I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from the gym when I was 
working out last week on January the 9th."
*/


-- Confirm if Witness 2 is a member of said gym.
/*
SELECT * FROM get_fit_now_member 
WHERE name LIKE "%Annabel%"
LIMIT 5
*/
-- Witness 2 Name Matches Current Member Database at the Gym id 90081, person_id 16371, 
-- but Not Witness 1.  However, no check ins corresponding to the member roster.

-- Find the membership_ids of members who checked in on the date from 
-- the witness statement.
/*
SELECT * FROM get_fit_now_check_in
WHERE check_in_date LIKE "20180109"
*/
-- 2 Entries match leading characters 48Z for membership: 
-- 48Z7A 1600 to 1730
-- 48Z55 1530 to 1700

-- Put Names to Member IDs
/*
SELECT * FROM get_fit_now_member 
WHERE id = "48Z7A" OR id = "48Z55"
*/
-- 48Z55, Person_ID 67318 Jeremy Bowers (Gold Member sinze 20160101)
-- 48Z7A, Person_ID 28819 Joe Germuska (Gold Member since 20160305)

-- See if I can match a license plate to one of the above, which includes H42W...
/*
SELECT a.id, a.name, b.gender, b.plate_number, b.car_make, b.car_model 
FROM drivers_license b
JOIN person a
ON a.license_id = b.id
WHERE b.plate_number LIKE "%H42W%" AND b.gender = "male"
*/
-- (Alternative Coding to get this answer)
/*
SELECT gender, plate_number, car_make, car_model 
FROM drivers_license
WHERE plate_number LIKE "%H42W%"
*/

/* RESULT:
2 Male-owned vehicles: 0H42W2 Chevrolet Spark LS
                       4H42WR Nissan Altima
*/

-- Did anyone attend events on the day of the murder?
/*
SELECT * FROM facebook_event_checkin 
WHERE person_id = 16371
*/

/* Interesting findings...
--Jeremy Bowers checked in to The Funky Grooves Tour on the date of the murder.
-- Joe Germuska had no checkins
--Annabel (Witness 2) also checked in to The Funky Grooves Tour on the date of the murder.
*/

-- Check for an interview by the 2 vehicle owners matching the license plate report.
/*
SELECT * FROM interview
WHERE person_id = 28819 or person_id = 67318
*/

/*
Jeremy Bowers confesses in interview statement to being the hitman, hired by a woman -- 
5'5" (65") to 5'7" (67"); red hair.  Drives Tesla Model S.
3 SQL Symphony Concert Attendances in Dec. 2017.
*/

-- SQL Query to see if my conclusion on who had done it was correct.
/*
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');

SELECT value FROM solution;
*/
-- I win!  I found who had done it; Jeremy Bowers was the killer.

-- Attempt to find the mastermind who bank rolled the hit.
/*
SELECT a.id, a.name, b.gender, b.hair_color, b.height, b.car_make, b.car_model, c.annual_income
FROM drivers_license b
JOIN person a
ON a.license_id = b.id
JOIN income c
ON a.ssn = c.ssn
WHERE b.gender = "female" AND b.car_make = "Tesla" AND b.car_model = "Model S"
*/

/*2 names had come up:
-- Red Korb id 78881, and...
-- Miranda Priestly id 99716
*/

-- Check Result:
/*
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Miranda Priestly');

SELECT value FROM solution;
*/
-- Miranda Priestly was the mastermind who bank rolled the hit.
